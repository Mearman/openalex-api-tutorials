One of the most important of these features is **faster updates,** allowing you to keep your data fully synced with OpenAlex.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way we do this is by using the `from_created_date` [(doc)](https://docs.openalex.org/api-entities/works/filter-works#from_created_date) or the `from_updated_date` [(doc)](https://docs.openalex.org/api-entities/works/filter-works#from_created_date) filters. These filters allow you to get the new works you need to keep your data updated, and they require a Premium API Key to work.\n",
